## Installation
Open a terminal in a root directory and run `bash scripts/startDev.sh`. From there you can access the following: 

- API on `http://localhost:3000/`
- Client on `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` or `http://172.20.0.3:8080`

## Usage
To use the program, go to client and add a new post. To access it, remember the path of your post. You can also edit the post later.

## Future changes
- The functionality of editing will be available to users only if they created the post (accessing the IP of the user). 
- There should also be an option to delete a post.
